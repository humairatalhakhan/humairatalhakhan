# Hi, I'm Humaira Talha! 👋

**Aspiring Data Analyst | Business Coordinator | Exploring the intersection of business and data**

## 🚀 About Me

I currently work as a Business Coordinator, where I support team operations and help align day-to-day activities with broader business goals. Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in data analytics and how data can be used to drive smarter decision-making.

I'm currently enrolled in the Data Analytics Essentials and actively building my GitHub site to showcase my learning progress and personal projects. My areas of interest include data visualization, KPI tracking, and transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights.

This shift toward analytics comes from a desire to not just support business functions, but to better understand the impact of decisions and strategies through data. I enjoy problem-solving, continuous learning, and exploring tools that help bridge the gap between business questions and data answers.

Outside of work, I spend time learning new tools and techniques in analytics, following industry trends, and connecting with others in the data space.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/humairatalha/)

I’m always open to learning from others and sharing what I’m working on.

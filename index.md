# Hi, I’m Humaira Talha! 👋  

**Aspiring Data Analyst | Business Coordinator | Exploring the Intersection of Business and Data**

---

## 🚀 About Me  
I currently work as a **Business Coordinator**, where I support team operations and help align day-to-day activities with broader business goals.  

Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in **data analytics** — how data can drive smarter decision-making and improve business performance.  

I’m currently enrolled in **Data Analytics Essentials** and actively building my GitHub site to showcase my **learning progress** and **personal projects**.  

My areas of interest include:
- 📊 Data Visualization & KPI Dashboards  
- 📈 Business Reporting & Process Insights  
- 🧮 Transforming raw data into actionable insights  

This shift toward analytics comes from my passion for understanding how data impacts decisions and strategies. I enjoy problem-solving, continuous learning, and exploring tools that connect **business goals** with **data-driven results**.  

Outside of work, I enjoy learning new tools, following analytics trends, and connecting with other data enthusiasts.
